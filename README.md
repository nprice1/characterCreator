# DND 5e Random Character Generator

This project sets out to randomly generate a random DND character. It will create most of the information 
required for the character sheet, as well as a random sprite animation based on that character.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose

## Starting

To run the project, run `docker-compose up` in the root directory. This will build the server and client
docker images and start both. Then visit `http://localhost:3000` to generate a character.
